Hello fellows, anyone tested convector suite and hurley with hyperledger fabric 2.0 yet?
any problems encountered?
thanks m8s

I don't know what you mean by 2.0 . It is not fully released yet. but yes you can install and run convector made chaincode

do you try it already? what is need to do in hurley to use 2.0?

mvishnoiHoje às 23:56
just keep in mind...2.0 has changed invoke command where you need to specify each and every peer and it's address to run command
hurley doesn't work with 2.0
you can cc:package a chaincode and install it on 2.0 network

I almost finish my API, I think next month I will bootstratp my first network and it is awesome if I use 2.0 :slight_smile:

keep in mind 2.0 doesn't provide KAFKA ordering service
