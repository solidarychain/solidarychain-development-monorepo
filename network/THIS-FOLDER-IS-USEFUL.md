seem that we need only the production network folder in `@SolidaryChain/solidarychain-production-network/fabric-samples/5node2channel/server-graphql/deployServerToNode.sh`, this folder exists when we have deployment and server files on node1, now it is not need anymore

SOME FILES ARE USED IN
@SolidaryChain/solidarychain-development-monorepo/packages/server-graphql/network.env

- KEY_STORE=/media/mario/Storage/Documents/Development/@SolidaryChain/solidarychain-development-monorepo/network/generated/wallets/.hfc-org1
- NETWORK_PROFILE=/media/mario/Storage/Documents/Development/@SolidaryChain/solidarychain-development-monorepo/network/org1.network-profile-raft.yaml
